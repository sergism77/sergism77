<summary>A Journey Through Sound</summary>

For over three decades, sound has been my medium of exploration—shaping raw noise, melodies, and sonic landscapes across different genres and eras. From the visceral energy of early underground bands to the more intricate layers of experimental soundscapes, my musical path has been one of collaboration, evolution, and relentless curiosity.

My work spans a wide range of genres, including metal, noise, drone, free jazz, and contemporary classical music. I have collaborated with a diverse array of artists, musicians, and performers, creating a rich tapestry of sound that reflects my passion for experimentation and innovation.

In addition to my work as a musician, I have also been involved in various sound art projects, installations, and performances. These endeavors have allowed me to explore the intersection of sound, technology, and the natural world, creating immersive experiences that challenge traditional notions of music and art.

I do not have a specific genre or style that defines my work; instead, I embrace the fluidity of sound and the endless possibilities it offers. My goal is to create music that resonates with listeners on a deep level, inviting them to explore their own relationship with sound and the world around them.

I self-publish my music on my label [Antsy Records](https://antsyrecords.bandcamp.com/), and some of the recordings are also digitally distributed on most of the streaming platforms.

<summary>Just A Bit More About Me</summary>

A wandering spirit drawn to the edges of art, nature, and technology, I am an interdisciplinary artist, forest beekeeper, and eco-driven technologist building resilient, mycelium-inspired data ecosystems. My journey began with sound—over 30 years as a musician—and grew into a deep dive into digital realms, from early CD-ROM development in the 90s to today’s decentralized networks. Formally trained in sound engineering and art direction, I have woven diverse experiences into a practice rooted in ecological stewardship and transparent collaboration.

Back in 2004 I started the [Abdicate Cell](https://archive.org/details/abdicate_cell) netlabel. It was mainly to self-publish my sound works, but ended up publishing a lot of other artists.

Through Abdicate Cell I connected with many artists and musicians. It was a great experience and it helped me to understand the importance of collaboration and community in the creative process. I believe that art should be accessible to everyone.

My artistic practice is a blend of sound, technology, and nature, exploring the intersections of these realms. I am particularly interested in how technology can be used to create more sustainable and ethical systems, and how art can help us to reconnect with the natural world. My work often involves collaboration with other artists, musicians, and technologists, as I believe that the best ideas come from working together.

As a forest beekeeper, I am deeply committed to ecological stewardship and the preservation of biodiversity. I believe that technology should be used to support and enhance our relationship with nature, rather than exploit it. My work often reflects this philosophy, as I seek to create systems that are not only functional but also beautiful and harmonious with the natural world.

Currently, my focus is on [Seigr](https://github.com/Seigr-lab/Seigr-EcoSystem), an ambitious project under the Seigr-lab organization. Seigr is a symbiotic, eco-inspired decentralized data ecosystem designed to harmonize technology with nature's adaptive intelligence. Inspired by mycelium networks, it aims to create sustainable, self-healing, and ethical data architectures that function like natural ecosystems—capable of growth, resilience, and healing. With Seigr, I envision a technological framework that aligns with ecological principles, prioritizes transparency, and fosters decentralized collaboration. Join me at [Seigr-lab on GitHub](https://github.com/Seigr-lab) to learn more and contribute to a new vision of ethical and eco-driven tech.

Although it may seem like a contradiction to some, I am quite eremitic (not religious kind). I have a strong need for solitude and silence, and I often find myself retreating to the forest. I believe that this connection to nature is essential for my creative process, and it helps me to maintain a sense of balance in my life.

So I am transitioning to a more hermit-like lifestyle, where I can focus on my art and my connection to nature. I am also transitioning my home sound studio and all my coding into the forest, where I have an old cabin that I am restoring. This project is a work in progress, and I see it as a long-term commitment. I restore the cabin with nature in mind, using local materials and techniques that are in harmony with the environment. I have my Seigr apiary there.

My work is a reflection of my values and my beliefs, and I hope to inspire others to think about their own relationship with technology and nature. I believe that we can create a better world by working together, and I am committed to using my art and my skills to make a positive impact.

There are social media leftovers from my past life, but I am not active on them. In fact, although I strongly believe in collaboration and sharing, I do have zero trust. I do believe we can achieve new levels of collaboration that do not involve blind trust—especially in these times of AI and big data.

Trust is something that needs to be earned by doing, not just by saying. To be honest, I am tired of people that mask themselves under false names pretending to be someone they are not. We already have way too many problems to solve, and I do not have the time nor health to deal with that. I am not saying I am perfect, but I do try to be honest and transparent in my work and my life.

So if you are willing to contact me, it has to be through my music, my honey, or my code.

If you are interested and have read this far, then you already know where to find me: on [Bandcamp](https://antsyrecords.bandcamp.com/), on [GitHub](https://github.com/Seigr-lab), or in the forest.
